Steps:

Integrate GitBash in VSCODE
In the CLI, htdocs folder run:
composer create project laravel/laravel scientificpapers

change vhosts to redirect scientificpapers.test to the index page instead of the public folder:
    edit vhosts file in apache/conf folder, and hosts file in sys32/drivers/etc

Create a Main controller:
    php artisan make:controller MainController
